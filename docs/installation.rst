Installation
============

* Compile the shared library via CMake in a seperate directory
* Build the bundled gromacs-4.6.5 being sure to define GMX_GIFS with the root of this repository
* The gifs_build.sh script will do both of the above if you like.
* Make sure you're using Q-Chem 5.4.1 or later with you $QC variable set correctly
* Try some of the examples in the examples folder; run.sh will get each example going.
