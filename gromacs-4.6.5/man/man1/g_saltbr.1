.SH DESCRIPTION
\&\fB g_saltbr\fR plots the distance between all combination of charged groups
\&as a function of time. The groups are combined in different ways.
\&A minimum distance can be given (i.e. a cut\-off), such that groups
\&that are never closer than that distance will not be plotted.


\&Output will be in a number of fixed filenames, \fB min\-min.xvg\fR, \fB plus\-min.xvg\fR
\&and \fB plus\-plus.xvg\fR, or files for every individual ion pair if the \fB \-sep\fR
\&option is selected. In this case, files are named as \fB sb\-(Resname)(Resnr)\-(Atomnr)\fR.
\&There may be \fB many\fR such files.
